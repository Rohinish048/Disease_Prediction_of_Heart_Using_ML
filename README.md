# Disease_Prediction_of_Heart_using_ML
Addressing heart disease has become a critical priority in modern healthcare. Leveraging data-driven systems to predict and prevent heart-related conditions can significantly enhance research and prevention strategies, enabling more individuals to lead healthier lives. This is where Machine Learning (ML) plays a transformative role, offering highly accurate predictions for heart disease risk.

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of heart disease patients, carefully preprocessing the data to ensure quality insights. Multiple ML models were trained and evaluated, employing algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and others. The implementation was carried out using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, which was featured in my Kaggle kernel, "Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras."

This classification task focused on predicting heart disease presence based on various patient parameters. The binary outcome indicated whether a patient was at risk or not. Below is an overview of the ML techniques applied:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network with a single hidden layer (Keras)
   
Verdict : Among these, the Random Forest algorithm achieved an impressive accuracy of 95%, highlighting its effectiveness in this classification problem.
